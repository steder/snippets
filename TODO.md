   and sent to others)
 - config file for db settings
 - url_for everywhere
 - @mention (ways to refer to users and create links to users in plaintext)
 - '#tags' (ways to refer to tags and create links to tags in plaintext)
 - rename from snippets
 - alternative ways to input snippets / status messages in addition to webform
   + email
   + hipchat
   + sms

 - groups of users (aliases) e.g.: being able to follow @devteam instead of following @alice, @bob, @carol and @dave
 - groups of tags (aliases), e.g.: '#postgres' and '#postgresql' are likely the same tag 
 - global tags (currently all tags are owned by a user, and a user can completely remove a tag from the db)
 - angular.js frontend

 - tests: no unittest suite at the moment at all!
